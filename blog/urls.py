    # Unnamed capturing groups (just a parenthesis) are passed to your view as arguments.
    # The ?P is a named capturing group, as opposed to an unnamed capturing group.

    # (?P<pk>\d+) â€“ this part means Django will take everything that you place here and transfer it
    # to a view as a variable called pk
    # \d also tells us that it can only be a digit, not a letter (so everything between 0 and 9).
    # + means that there needs to be one or more digits there
